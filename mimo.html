        <h1>How We Made Our Business</h1>
         <p>well , at the begining it wasn't easy , first we needed to make a market research to know about our revails in the market , then we begin to study them to pubilsh our great cafe ,<strong> The Mad Coffee </strong> was an idea , then it's time has come to be true, but for me the important stage to define my goal and how i will make it so who doesn't want a cup of coffee after waking up , hard day full of work . </p>

            <p>"Happiness is actually found in simple things, such as taking my nephew around the island by bicycle or seeing the stars at night. We go to coffee shops or see airplanes land at the airport."</p>
